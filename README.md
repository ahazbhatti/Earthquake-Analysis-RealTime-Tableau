# Earthquake-Analysis-Tableau

An earthquake is a vibration or shaking that occurs due to a shift or movement of the earth layer originating from the base of the earth's surface. Earthquakes are recorded from Seismometers. The variable for Seismometers is called Nst, and is on the visuzation, how many seismic stations there are in total for an earthquake location. According to the United States Geological Survey website the USGS monitors and reports earthquakes, assesses their consequences and risks, and conducts specialized research on earthquake sources and effects. These efforts are part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), a four-agency collaboration established by Congress. This data is updated every minute and can go back up to 30 days. The dataset contains historical data as well for earthquakes. There is also an option to select real time data only for the past hour, day, week and month. 

The process for the project starts from collecting the data. For analyzing we needed realtime data about Earthquakes. For this purpose, the data was collected from the United States Geological Survey which contained all the data from the government database about earthquakes which happened over the past 30 days.

Once the API was collected the individual xls file was imported to Google Sheets using the import function. Google Sheets is a spreadsheet just like excel and real time data is stored inside this sheet and updated every minute.
